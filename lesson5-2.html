                <pre>
- Switches intelligently route data between network segments, offering greater efficiency than hubs. They enable devices with mismatched speeds to
communicate effectively and are crucial for large networks and data centers.          
                </pre>

                <br><div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub1">Role of Switches in a Network</h2>
                <pre>
- Switches serve as network connection points for hosts at the network's edge.
- In hierarchical network architectures, switches are also used deeper in the network to connect edge switches.
- Commercial switches may have built-in or modular interfaces to connect diverse network types like Ethernet, Fibre Channel, RapidIO, ATM, ITU-T G.hn, and 802.11.
- Connectivity is possible across different network layers:
    - Layer 2: Handles bandwidth-shifting within the same technology.
    - Layer 3: Facilitates interconnecting diverse technologies (e.g., Ethernet and token ring) via routing, typically performed by routers.
- Modern switches may support Power over Ethernet (PoE) to supply power to devices like VoIP phones and wireless access points without separate power sources.
- Redundant power circuits in switches, connected to uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), ensure continued device operation during power failures.

                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub2">Form Factors of Switches</h2>
                <pre>
Switches come in various form factors for different environments:
> Stand-alone desktop units: Used in home or office settings.
> Rack-mounted switches: Installed in equipment racks or enclosures, available as standalone, stackable, or large chassis units with swappable line cards.
> DIN rail-mounted switches: Designed for industrial environments.
> Small installation switches: Mounted in cable ducts, floor boxes, or communication towers, often used in fiber-to-the-office setups.

                <h1 id="heading4">Router</h1>
                <p>- Routers direct data packets between different networks, acting as gateways. They analyze data packets and route them efficiently while providing security by controlling data flow.</p>
                <br>

                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub4">Works of the Routers</h2>
                <pre>
- Essential for routing traffic between networks, facilitating the movement of data packets.
- Acts as a gateway between networks, contributing to both data direction and network security.

Main purposes:
1. Directing Data: Ensures data reaches the correct destination (e.g., email to the right provider and recipient).
2. Security: Prevents unauthorized data distribution, protecting network performance (e.g., stopping large files from being sent to all machines on a network).

                <pre>
- Nearly all hubs and network cards sold today are what are often called 10base-T or 100base-T.
    - That simply means you use cables called UTP Cat5 24 AWG, they have connector ends on them that resembles a telephone connector.
    - The telephone connector is actually smaller, called an RJ-11 connector, while a 10base-T connector is an RJ-45.
    - But, they are nearly alike, except for size.
- UTP cable can only support the distance up to 100 meters, more than that a repeater or a hub will be useful.
                </pre>
                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub8">UTP CAT5 24 AWG</h2>
                <pre>
- It stands for the Unshielded Twisted Pair Category 5 with 24 American Wire Gauge
- This is the type of cable which is commonly used in networking.
- Although there are many cables out in the market, this is the most suitable for building a network.

- RJ-45 is short for Registered Jack45, an eight-wire connector used commonly to connect computers onto Local Area Networks (LANs), especially Ethernets.
- RJ-45 connectors look similar to the ubiquitous RJ-11 connectors used for connecting telephone equipment, but they are somewhat wider.

<i> Notes:
    * You can buy this terminated cable in some computer shops but they are only sold on a specific length.
    * If you would like to create one for yourself (which is very easy, I bet you would like to try one), just follow the given steps in terminating cables.
    * This cable will be terminated from end to end with an RJ-45, therefore you must understand the color codes of each wire.
    * In a Local Area Network, you must understand that there are different cable runs that you are going create, the STRAIGHT THROUGH, the CROSSOVER, and the ROLLOVER cables.
    * We do not roll over cable as of now.

        - TIA 568-B.1-2000 (Commercial Building Telecommunications Wiring Standard)
        - The year 2000 update packages all the previous addendums and service updates into a new release and, most important, specifies that Category 5E cable is the preferred
        cable type that can provide minimum acceptable performance levels.
        - Several addendums were also released that specify technical information for 100-ohm twisted-pair cable, shielded twisted-pair cable, and optical fiber cable.

                <pre>
- It is used also in LANs, basically, and is often used in home networks when connecting two Ethernet computers without a hub.
- It has its send and receives wires crossed.
- It is a type of cable that is used to connect SAME or SIMILAR devices such as PC to PC, Hub to Hub, or Switch to Switch.

                <h3>1. (EMI) Electro-Magnetic Interference</h3>
                <pre>
- EMI is interference caused by electrical or magnetic radiation from nearby sources such as power cables, heavy machinery, or fluorescent lighting.
- Effects: Causes disruptions in signal transmission or reception, leading to Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).
- Prevention:
    - Keep network cables at least 12 inches away from electrical cables.
    - Use shielded cables instead of Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) if necessary.
- Impact: While it may not significantly affect signal quality, it can be problematic if field strength exceeds 1 Volt per meter.
                </pre>

                <br><h3>2. Noise</h3>
                <pre>
- Noise is unwanted electrical interference that distorts or disrupts the signal. It can be either temporary (transient) or constant.
- Impact: Affects the clarity of the desired signal, much like static or interference on a radio.
                </pre>

                <br><h3>3. Crosstalk</h3>
                <pre>
- Crosstalk is interference where signals from one cable induce EMI in an adjacent cable.
- Causes: Result from capacitive, inductive, or conductive coupling between circuits or channels.
- Prevention:
    - Twisting the wires in twisted-pair cables helps reduce crosstalk.
    - Additional shielding or physical separation between cables can further minimize interference.
- Impact: Significant in structured cabling, audio electronics, and other communication systems.

                <h2 id="sub12">How to Prevent Noise in Cables?</h2>
                <h3>1. Shielding</h3>
                <pre>
- Shielded cables are used to protect the data being transferred through the cable from degradation by EMI exposure, which is common in data
centers, industrial settings, offices, and other settings where computer technology, electrical equipment, or electronic equipment is in heavy use.
                </pre>
                <br>
                <h3>2. Cancellation</h3>
                <pre>
- The twisting of wires causes EMI and crosstalk signals to cancel itself out.
- The main difference between the different categories of UTP is the quality of the copper that is used to make the conductors and how tightly twisted the wires are together.

<b>Crimping Tool</b>
- A crimping tool is a tool designed to crimp or connect a connector to the end of a cable.
- Examples:
    Network cables and phone cables are created using a crimping tool to connect the RJ-45 and RJ-11 connectors
    to the end of the cable.

<b>Wire Stripper</b>
- It is a pair of opposing blades much like scissors or wire cutters.
- The center notch or hollow makes it easier to cut the insulation without cutting the wire.
- This type of wire stripper is used by rotating it around the insulation while applying pressure in order to
make a cut around the insulation.
