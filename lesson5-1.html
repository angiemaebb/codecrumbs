                <pre>
A computer network consists of devices like computers, servers, and peripherals connected to share data and resources. Networks can range from simple, like 
two computers connected by a cable, to complex systems like the Internet. Devices such as hubs or wireless communication facilitate connections, enabling data exchange.
                </pre>
                <div class="cardi"><h2>Simple Network</h2>
                <pre>
A network is more than just a collection of computers; it creates new capabilities by offering connectivity and sharing. Networking allows for shared resources and
facilitates communication, which enhances productivity beyond individual machine capabilities.

                <p>Network topology defines the physical and logical arrangement of network elements, affecting the system's efficiency and reliability. Common topologies include:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub4">1. Star Topology</h2>
                <pre>
All devices connect to a central hub or switch. Itâ€™s easy to set up, but if the hub fails, the whole network is affected.

> Advantages:
- If N devices are connected to each other in a star topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is N.
    - So, it is easy to set up
- Each device requires only 1 port (i.e., to connect to the hub).

> Disadvantages:
- If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies fails, the whole system will crash down.
- The cost of installation is high.
- Performance is based on the single concentrator (i.e., hub).
                </pre>
                <img src="part 1/star.PNG" alt="star topology" class="img2"></div>

                <br>
                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub5">2. Bus Topology</h2>
                <pre>
Devices share a single backbone cable. It's cost-effective but vulnerable to network crashes if the cable fails.

> Advantages:
- If N devices are connected to each other in a bus topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is 1 which is known as backbone cable, and N drop lines are required.
- The cost of the cable is less as compared to other topology, but it is used to build small networks.

> Disadvantages:
- If the common cable fails, then the whole system will crash down.
- If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network.
    - To avoid this, various protocols are used in the Media Access Control (MAC) layer known as Pure Aloha, Slotted Aloha, Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (CSMA/CD), etc.

                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub6">3. Ring Topology</h2>
                <pre>
Devices form a closed-loop. It uses a token to transfer data, minimizing collisions, but troubleshooting can be difficult.

There are two types of token release techniques:
A. Early token release releases the token just after the transmitting the data
B. Delay token release releases the token after the acknowledgment is received from the receiver.

> Advantages:
- The possibility of collision is minimum in this type of topology.
- Cheap to install and expand.

> Disadvantages:
- Troubleshooting is difficult in this topology.
- The addition of stations in between or removal of stations can disturb the whole topology.

                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub7">4. Mesh Topology</h2>
                <pre>
Each device connects to every other device with dedicated channels, offering high security and reliability but is costly and complex to install.

> Advantages:
- It is robust.
- The fault is diagnosed easily.
- Data are reliable because data are transferred among the devices through dedicated channels or links.
- Provides security and privacy.

> Disadvantages:
- Installation and configuration is difficult.
- Cost of cables are high as bulk wiring is required, hence, suitable for fewer number of devices.
- Cost of maintenance is high.

                <div class="cardi"><h2 id="sub8">5. Hybrid Topology</h2>
                <pre>
Combines multiple topologies for flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance, though itâ€™s more complex and expensive to design.

> Advantages:
- Reliable: Fault detection and troubleshooting are easier, isolating issues without affecting the whole network.
- Scalable: Easily expandable without disrupting existing architecture.
- Flexible: Can be tailored to meet organizational needs and optimize resources.
- Effective: Combines strengths of multiple topologies, maximizing benefits and minimizing weaknesses.

> Disadvantages:
- Complex Design: Designing and configuring the network is challenging and requires expertise.
- Costly Hub: Specialized, expensive hubs are needed to connect different topologies.
- Expensive Infrastructure: Requires substantial investment in cables, cooling, and sophisticated devices.
